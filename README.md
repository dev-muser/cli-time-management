# Time Management - Simple CLI Assistant.

Time management utility that helps user to focus and keeps track of time spent.

User just need to give the time unit and the concern / job / workout (pomodoro
style) and it will be alerted and data will be also saved.

I wrote about this utility app and my motivation on my blog [tech-dev](https://tech-dev.xyz).
